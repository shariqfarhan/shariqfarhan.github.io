### Key Projects

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP) - LLM Based
- **Uber Data Platform Insights**: Conducted in-depth analysis of user queries to uncover pain points, leading to actionable insights and product enhancements that improved user satisfaction. Processed 5000+ conversations to identify 5 major pain points, which were addressed and integrated into the product.
- **Uber Freight Data Assistant**: Developed an automated response system for frequently asked queries, significantly reducing manual effort. Integrated data from multiple internal tools to provide real-time updates, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency. This solution addresses ~60% of the queries on the platform.
- **[LLM Chat Agent](https://github.com/shariqfarhan/LLM_Frontend)**: Created a chat tool leveraging OpenAI, LlamaIndex, and Streamlit, integrating open-source tools for search, weather, and code execution.
- **Data Whisperer**: Engineered an LLM-based chatbot for dynamic data interaction, showcased during a hackathon, demonstrating innovative use of language models to facilitate data-driven conversations.

#### Computer Vision (CV)

- **Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion**: Implemented **ControlNet** on Stable Diffusion using a custom Pokémon dataset. Handled the project end-to-end, including converting images to canny edges, generating descriptions, and fine-tuning the model. Checkpoints were created, and images were compared at various steps to monitor progress and optimize outputs.

- **Custom Image Detection - YOLO**: Developed a custom image detection model for identifying landmarks in Hyderabad, India. Managed the complete process, including data annotation, model training, and evaluation. [Project Link](https://github.com/shariqfarhan/Explore/tree/master/Assignment_12)

#### Intelligent Systems
- **Mastermind Anomaly Analysis**: Designed and implemented an automated system to analyze anomalies in [Mastermind](https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/mastermind/), Uber’s internal tool for detecting fraudulent user behavior. The system identifies the root cause of alerts by analyzing feature drift, changes in user patterns, or genuine instances of suspicious activity. Automated analysis streamlines stakeholder workflows by determining causes of alerts and providing actionable insights for necessary interventions.

#### Data Analytics

- **Safety Experimentation**: Spearheaded the analysis and readout for Uber's 4W [Safety Education](https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/safety/tips/) program in Latin America, an initiative to promote safe driving practices among earners. Designed and conducted an experiment to encourage safer driving behaviors, delivering key insights to refine the program and improve earner engagement.  

- **Scoping Accuracy Improvement**: Led efforts to enhance bug scoping accuracy for the Rider Line of Business. Implemented targeted analysis and process improvements, increasing scoping accuracy from less than 30% to approximately 80%. These improvements contributed to more efficient issue resolution and a significantly improved user experience.  Bugs are identified using [various techniques](https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/shifting-e2e-testing-left/), scoping helps to prioritize the most impactful bugs

- **Uber Data Platform (UDP) Analytics**: Partnered with the [Uber Data Platform](https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/diving-into-ubers-cutting-edge-data-infrastructure) team to design and implement a scalable analytics solution. Focused on driving process optimization, product improvements, and robust process governance. The solution enabled teams to identify inefficiencies, implement targeted enhancements, and improve overall platform performance.
